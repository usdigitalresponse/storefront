This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is a single page app in React with a serverless backend currently being served by Netlify.

## Development

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />

### `yarn start:api`
Runs a proxy for the serverless API in development.


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
